after a while you being to see if you asking the right quesitons to the search based on how relevant the hits are. You refine this overtime. 

1. Ask it 100% exactly the way you have thought out in your mind WITHOUT anything specific to you personally so generalize it 
2. ask it like you are asking a computer who does not understand complete phrases only KEY words
